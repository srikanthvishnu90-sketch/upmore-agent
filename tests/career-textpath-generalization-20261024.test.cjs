/* GENERALIZATION (coordinator directive 2026-10-24 14:04) — fail-first.
   File v1's fixes keyed too closely to its fifteen conversations:
   on a fresh private family the banner still took 24/30. These
   tests exercise the four MECHANISMS on families invented here —
   different topics and shapes from file v1's fifteen and from the
   coordinator's private families:
     (1) catch-all after all handlers (AMENDED 14:09: no claimed
         understanding, no restated intent — didn't catch + the
         REALLY served capabilities + ONE bounded question; no
         canned specifics on deadlines/legal/benefits)
     (2) bare-reply resolver (no pending question, no standing
         offer -> name the last thing discussed, never the banner,
         never a record confirm)
     (3) frame carry for follow-up/draft frames (silence reports
         and held drafts resolve their follow-ups from the frame)
     (4) intent/life-event statements are NOT goals (the event
         verb governs the job noun -> no goal write; a human reply
         plus a next-step offer instead)
   The coordinator's two NAMED wrong answers are in their own
   section at the bottom, labeled as what they are: coordinator-
   supplied regression shapes, not invented families.
