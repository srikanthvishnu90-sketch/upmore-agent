// WO-055 (architect): sealed sample D, scored once on trunk 0175e523 (then spent), found 24 wrong fills of 636 and 13 not
// settled. Two causes: a job abroad (work rights and pay there are that country's, not the person's US facts) and a
// question that names a fact's topic but asks more than the fact says (a second degree, a visa type, whether moving is
// needed, a vendor's history). Each is asked; the person's own facts keep answering what they do say. Synthetic persona
// (Chicago, IL; US authorized, no sponsorship; expects 95000, earns 85000); real employers' questions and locations.
