// WO-032: applying by email, for a posting whose application is "email your resume to X" (career_postings.apply_email,
// found in ingestion by apply_email.ts). One turn, before any brain, like the card and the questions:
//   "apply by email to Acme" (or "apply to Acme by email", optionally "for <title>") prepares the email card: the address
//   the posting gives, a subject from the posting's title, a body drafted ONLY from the person's confirmed facts through
//   WO-030's drafting and fact-lock (essay_draft.ts: the employer's AI policy first, every name and number traced to a
//   confirmed fact or the posting, the length met by rewriting, never by cutting), and the resume attached: the one
//   WO-028 tailors to this posting from confirmed facts (career_tailor.ts).
//   The whole email is shown; nothing is sent.
//   "yes", while that card is the thread's last word, sends exactly that payload, once, from the person's own Gmail
//   (users.messages.send through the career grant): one recipient, no Cc, no Bcc. The database takes the yes only for the
//   payload hash on the card, within a day, under the daily limit, one per posting and one per company per 30 days
//   (career_apply_email_reserve_as), and the send is recorded on a tracked application (source 'email').
//   "subject: ..." or "body: ..." changes the email and shows it again; the change needs its own yes. "no" drops it.
// The owner's switch (CAREER_EMAIL_SEND=on) off: the yes is told so, nothing is reserved or sent, the card is kept (WO-091c).
// No career grant that may send: NOT_WIRED, with the one thing to do, and nothing is reserved. No resume Trainee can
// attach: NOT_WIRED the same way. The model writes sentences only; code decides everything that matters.
