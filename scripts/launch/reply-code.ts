// REPLY CODE: the one definition of "the code that decides what Trainee replies" (D-034, the deploy standard's S3).
// A reply-quality measurement of one commit stands for another commit only when these paths are identical in both, and
// a measurement commit on ci/brain-eval carries exactly the measured commit's copy of them. Nothing else reads its own
// list: scripts/launch/deploy-standard.ts (S3) and scripts/launch/measure-reply.sh import this file.
//
// What is in it, and why:
//   packages/domain/                         the router's source (scripts/build-router-core.py --career-only bundles it)
//   supabase/functions/_shared/router_core.career.js   the router bundle itself (what the career entry imports)
//   supabase/functions/agent-chat/           the chat entry, the agent brain (career_brain.ts), the staged split
//   supabase/functions/_shared/agent/        the brain's loop, prompt, tools, reply guards, research and knowledge
//   SHARED_REPLY_MODULES below               every other _shared module the reply path imports: the static import closure
//                                            of the brain eval (evals/career/run.ts), file by file
// tests/architect/deploy-evidence.test.ts fails when the eval's import closure reaches a supabase/ or packages/ file this
// list does not cover (a new import must be added here), and when an entry names a file or directory that no longer
// exists (the list cannot rot silently). A path here that is not reply code costs only an extra measurement; a reply
// path missing here would let a reply change ride on an older measurement, so the test errs toward inclusion.
