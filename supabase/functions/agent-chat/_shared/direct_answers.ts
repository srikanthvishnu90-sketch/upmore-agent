// wrong or the flows not covering:
//   - "connect my fidelity": the model invented app steps (S16-19). Now the connector matrix answers: a live connect link,
//     the read-only Plaid path, a fallback while trading waits on approval, not built yet, off, or can't connect.
//   ("pay my rent" used to be answered here as not built. It is now the standing rent flow, packages/domain/81-standing-rent.js,
//   routed by AgentRouter through _shared/flow_router.ts, so nothing here intercepts it.)
//   - "find me money": the model's answer was swapped for a dispute fallback (S16-18). Now the save engine reads the
//     person's own transactions and ranks what it finds, every number from their rows, with the source and as-of date.
//     The subscription and shopping savings (packages/domain/85-subscription-savings.js: cheaper tier, annual switch, perk
//     overlap, rotation, Costco tier, Subscribe and Save) rank alongside, each title citing its offer-book term.
//   - balance and spending with nothing linked: the planner's fallback spoke in internal terms ("retained USD posted
//     records"). Now one plain line says nothing is connected and how to connect it.
// Pure apart from the injected readers, so tests/edge/direct-answers.test.ts drives them with fixtures.
