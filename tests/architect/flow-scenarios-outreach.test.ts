// NETWORKING OUTREACH END TO END (owner rules, 2026-10-30): a seeded sample of ~80 flows through the rail's own functions
// (career_send_enqueue / _claim / _go / _complete / _record / _replies_due, every migration) on real Postgres, the
// outreach and replies stores over the PostgREST double, and a fake Gmail at the HTTP boundary that keeps each account's
// Sent mail and threads. The pure battery is tests/architect/scenarios-outreach.test.ts; this reads the database's rows.
//   A  exactly once under failure: a lost answer, a break before Gmail took it, a 5xx, a 429, Gmail's quota in its own words,
//      a worker that died after Gmail took it; then the next runs: each address gets exactly one email, exactly as approved.
//   B  several sender instances at once over many people: each email exactly once.
//   C  an approval lives 7 days: queued behind a pause, then resumed; inside 7 days it goes, after it lapses (cancelled on
//      the rail, the draft skipped/'expired' so "show lapsed" finds it).
//   D  a follow-up due while an answer (a reply, a stop, a bounce) already sits on its sequence's threads, not yet read by
//      the reply check: never sent, the sequence stops; an out-of-office or a delay notice does not stop it.
//   E  an opt-out or a bounce to one person holds for everyone: another person's queued email is cancelled, their new one
//      refused, and the drafting store reports the address as blocked.
//   F  approvals bound to the chat that showed the batch, on the real drafts table (supabaseOutreachStore).
//   G  the card's address label rides on the queue row.
//   H  the replies lane drafts nothing for a paused person (career_quiet_users).
