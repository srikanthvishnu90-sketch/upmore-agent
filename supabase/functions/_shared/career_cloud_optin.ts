// WO-039: the person turns the cloud on and off in chat. Code's, like the card: the model never decides it.
//
// "apply for me in the cloud" shows the terms in exact words: which postings (only what they approve on a card, on
// Greenhouse, Lever and Ashby, on a site whose hand submissions employers have confirmed), how many a day (their own
// daily limit, one per company every 30 days), that each one still needs their yes on its card, and that a
// verification check comes back to them. Only an explicit "yes" (or "yes, turn it on") turns it on, and only when all of
// these hold: the terms are the thread's last word, they were shown in the last 30 minutes, nothing was texted to the
// person since (receipts, alerts and status texts go out through the outbox without being written to the thread, so
// "the last word" alone could be days old), and their hash is the hash of the terms as they would be shown now. One text
// turns it off ("cloud off"), at any time.
//
// Off is never "stop": over SMS, STOP is the carrier's opt-out keyword (trainee-inbound silences every text on it).
