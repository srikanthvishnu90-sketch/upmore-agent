// WO-107 (F3): one read model on the live path. "where are my applications", "did my application to X go through",
// "where do I stand with X", "who emailed me", "any news from X" and "what follow-ups are due" are answered by code,
// before the router, from one model built from the four records that did not see each other: career_apply_jobs (what
// Trainee sent), career_mail_events (what the employer's mail said), every thread's tracker (what the person told
// Trainee) and career_mail_drafts (follow-ups drafted, never sent). Each line says which record it came from; a record
// that cannot be read is named, never guessed; nothing is sent or drafted by any of these turns.
