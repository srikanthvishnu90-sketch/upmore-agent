// SUBMIT-STEER-1130 / SPLIT-1146 (c): "where are my applications", "did my application to Acme go through?", read back
// from career_apply_jobs, the one record of what was sent.
//
// The queue records each application's outcome there (career_apply_finish_own, the cloud worker, the employer's email
// confirmation). Before this the chat never read it: "where are my applications" answered from the router's own tracker,
// and a question about one employer got the banner. This answers from the record only:
//   - "submitted" only as recorded; "confirmed" only when the record says the employer confirmed it (their email). A
//     page's thank-you is "submitted, not confirmed yet"; an unknown outcome is unknown, and never sent again;
//   - an employer with no record is said to have none, never assumed sent;
//   - a record that cannot be read is said so; nothing is guessed.
// Anything that is not a question about where applications stand returns null, and the turn goes on as before.
