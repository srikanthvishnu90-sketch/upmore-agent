// FEATURE 13 (owner, 2026-10-25): the staged release of the agent brain. CAREER_BRAIN=staged sends to the brain only the
// turns that are questions, advice or conversation: a turn no code-first turn in handler-career.ts claimed, and that the
// router itself would answer with no action and no code product (nothing claimed it, or it fell to an advice or
// catch-all reply). Every action stays code's: the code-first turns, the host's controls, structured task and batch
// requests, and every router turn that is not on the list below. The router still answers when the model fails, and the
// owner keeps any turn class on the router by naming it in CAREER_BRAIN_ROUTER_INTENTS (comma separated; "unclaimed"
// is the class of turns no module claimed). D-035 (owner, 2026-11-01: "Ship staged brain"): which brain is served is the
// committed release config (release_config.ts PRODUCTION_BRAIN, now "staged"), so CAREER_BRAIN unset serves it; the
// environment only rolls back: CAREER_BRAIN=router (the kill switch, or any value but the release brain) makes nothing
// here true, and the router answers every turn exactly as before. CAREER_BRAIN=agent stays pinned off by AGENT_BRAIN_RELEASED.
//
// How a turn is classed: the router runs once on a disposable copy of the turn's state (no I/O; the real state is not
// touched), and its intent decides, except that a turn that asks something or forbids an action is the brain's unless the
// router's intent is code's own work (questionTurn, 2026-11-06); the router's answer then reaches the brain as data
// (routerAnswerBlock). A turn the brain does not take runs through the router again on the real state, as
// it does today, so what the router saves is exactly what it saved before.

// the brain takes it, names realistic entry roles from the work they do now (prompt.ts, "A change with no target role named
// yet"), reads real postings with search_jobs, and asks which to pursue. Both halves must be in the words (where they are now,
// where they want to go) and the router's own result must be empty with no role family asked: a search that found or asked

// a profile write, an erase, a refusal or safety reply, a search, or a bare yes or no; or the router built a real artifact
