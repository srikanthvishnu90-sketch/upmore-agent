#!/usr/bin/env bash
# staging/scripts/staging-up.sh — THE one command. Runs the whole staging bring-up
# in order against a staging project the OWNER created:
#   0. secret-name presence check (names only, via sb.py secrets-list — values
#      are never read, printed, or set by this package)
#   1. migrate.sh            (bootstrap + all migrations, in ls order)
#   2. deploy-functions.sh   (agent-chat, gmail-oauth, agent-exec)
#   3. seed.sh               (gauntlet test user + profiles row)
#   4. smoke.sh              (one career message -> oracle-checked reply)
#
# Usage (the exact single command, also in staging/README.md):
#   STAGING_REF=<staging-project-ref> bash staging/scripts/staging-up.sh
#   STAGING_REF=<staging-project-ref> bash staging/scripts/staging-up.sh --dry-run
#
# Secrets must already be set on the staging project by the owner before this
# runs (staging/OWNER-CHECKLIST.md). If a required name is missing, this stops
# BEFORE migrating or deploying anything and names what is missing.
