/* JOIN-1202/1213 step: module 155's readback, verified by measured
   drive — three applications in one approved batch:
   - TestCo 1: submitted WITH a recorded employer confirmation.
   - TestCo 2: the board accepted it, NO confirmation recorded.
   - TestCo 3: the drive itself errors (the board throws at submit).
   The readback (summarizeRun + speakSummary + accountRun) must
   (1) count the confirmed submission APART from the sent-unconfirmed
   one — never merged into one "submitted" number — and
   (2) never drop the errored row: it still appears, with its error.
   Sandbox boards only; nothing submits to a real employer.
   Check: node --test tests/career-submit-readback-155.test.cjs */
