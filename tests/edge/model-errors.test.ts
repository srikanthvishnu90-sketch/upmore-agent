// Live finding 2026-10-11 19:01 UTC (go-live on 4e1cf5c): every Anthropic call answered HTTP 400 and the code kept only
// the status, so the cause was invisible, and a balance question was answered "I couldn't complete the requested
// financial plan ... no payment was approved". These tests hold the fix: the provider's own error type and message are
// kept (never the key), the planner says plainly that the AI service isn't responding, and the router's problem names
// the cause.
