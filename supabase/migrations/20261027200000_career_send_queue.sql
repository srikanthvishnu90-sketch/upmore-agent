-- Mass networking, lane M1 (2026-10-27): the sending rail. Emails the person approved leave from their own Gmail
-- (D-MN-1), exactly once each, at whatever volume they approve. One queue serves every kind of email the person approves:
-- outreach (career_outreach_drafts), applications sent by email (APL-12) and any other email they ask Trainee to write.
--
-- Owner rules this file holds (2026-10-27, 19:52-20:40 CDT):
--   * No volume limit of Trainee's own: no daily number, no per-run number, no default spacing, no per-recipient number
--     across people. The only thing that slows an account is Gmail refusing (a quota or rate-limit answer): that account
--     backs off until Gmail allows (career_send_accounts.resume_at), the person is told once in plain words, and the rest
--     of the world keeps sending.
--   * Exactly once per approved email: the idempotency key is kind + the draft's id + its approval hash, unique. A send
--     that may have reached Gmail before a crash is checked against the person's Sent mail before it is ever tried again
--     (the worker, _shared/career_send_rail.ts); the claim only hands it back with its attempt count.
--   * Opt-out ("stop", "unsubscribe", "not interested") is honoured forever (career_outreach_dnc, kept through an erase);
--     a bounced address is never emailed again by anyone (career_send_bad_addresses, a hash only, names nobody).
--   * Never the same person twice for outreach, except the follow-ups the person approves (a sequence of any length,
--     each approved; the whole sequence stops at any reply, opt-out or bounce).
--   * Mailbox protection (reacting to outside signals, not a volume limit): when an account's own recent sends bounce
--     too often, or Gmail answers with a spam or policy refusal, that account's queue pauses, the person is told with the
--     numbers, and it resumes when they say so (career_send_resume).
--   * Disconnecting Gmail cancels everything still queued; an erase deletes the queue (career_erase_person finds the
--     tables from the catalog); deleting the account removes it all.
--
-- Scale (owner, 19:52 CDT): many sender instances run at once. A claim takes whole sender accounts with FOR UPDATE SKIP
-- LOCKED, oldest turn first (round robin: one heavy sender cannot starve anyone), leases the account and up to
-- per_account of its emails, and the fenced completion only lands for the lease that holds the row. Expired leases are
-- reclaimed by the next claim. No global lock, every hot read is an index range.
--
-- Everything here is the service role's: the person sees their state through the chat (career_send_status).
-- Idempotent: every statement can run twice.
