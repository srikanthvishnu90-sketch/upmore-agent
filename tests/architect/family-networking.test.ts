// FAMILY CERTIFICATION: networking and outreach (capability map NW-*; outreach emails, coffee-chat asks, follow-ups,
// referral asks, contact tracking), driven as a brand-new person would drive it, through the REAL chat handler
// (agent-chat/handler-career.ts handleChat) on real Postgres. The model is a scripted stand-in at the OpenAI URL; Google,
// Gmail and LinkedIn are never reachable (any request to them is counted and must stay 0). Nothing leaves the machine.
//
// What is certified, each by the database's own rows and a reply that says no more than they show:
//   1. Nothing on file: who/email asks answered plainly, with how to add people; nothing drafted, no model call.
//   2. Partial info typed in chat ("her email is ..."), with a typo in the verb: kept as the person's own contact, the
//      signature asked once, then one draft written only from confirmed facts.
//   3. Changing their mind: asking again for the same person replaces the waiting draft; "cancel 1" takes back an approved one.
//   4. Approval of the exact payload ("looks good, send it"): the row's approved_hash is the SHA-256 of exactly the shown
//      message; the reply says plainly Trainee can't send from their address yet and gives the ladder (copy, a mailto link
//      carrying exactly the approved recipient, subject and text, then "sent 1"). The scheduled send run, with the real
//      Gmail sender and no grant, sends nothing (NOT_WIRED) and makes no Google request.
//   5. "sent 1": marked sent by the person (never sendable again), a follow-up reminder set; "remind me in 3 days" moves
//      it; the scheduled reminder run queues it once to the person's outbox, only once due, never twice.
//   6. Tracking: "who have I reached out to" lists each person and where each stands; "Maya replied" turns the reminder off.
//   7. "follow up with Maya": a follow-up drafted from confirmed facts (not the application follow-up turn).
//   8. LinkedIn: messaging, connecting and searching on LinkedIn are refused plainly; nothing is recorded or sent.
//   9. Never invented: a claim not on record (and a prompt injection in a contact's title) is refused by the fact-lock;
//      no name is made up for a bare address.
//  10. Another person sees nothing and can change nothing; the texting-channel path (the service-role bridge every
//      texting channel uses) answers the same person from the same records.
// Measured per task: turns, wall time per turn (p50/p95), database requests per turn, model calls and tokens.
