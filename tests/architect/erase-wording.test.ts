// Review of #364 (2026-11-01): "forget everything" deletes the person's chat messages from Trainee's records (the
// agent_messages rows, career_erase_messages). Copies already delivered stay in the person's own Telegram, iMessage or
// WhatsApp app: Trainee cannot delete those, so no answer may say the messages go "on every channel". Every place that
// describes the erase says the messages are deleted from Trainee's records, and the confirmation says where copies stay.
