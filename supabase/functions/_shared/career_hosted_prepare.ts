// kicks (career_apply_from_chat.ts kickPrepare, CAREER_PREPARE_AHEAD_URL), and the reply says so instead of "the next
// time you prepare applications on your computer", which is not true for a person with only a phone. Only when every
// open question is answered (a preparation still waiting on one would only stop on it again), and only for postings in
// their own queue (the door takes nothing else). Nothing is approved, queued or sent here.
