"""MASS NETWORKING M5 load test (20261027240000_career_outreach_replies.sql), CI-runnable on the throwaway Postgres 16.

10,000 people each hold 5 approved actions (50,000), and one heavy person holds 5,000 more. 20 workers, each its own
session, claim through career_outreach_action_claim (100 per call, at most 2 per person per call) and finish each one,
until the queue is empty. Asserted: every action is claimed and finished exactly once (a log row per claim, unique by
action), none is left approved or running, and no call ever gave one person more than 2 (the heavy person cannot starve
anyone). Mailbox leases: 10,000 sync rows claimed by the same 20 workers, each row exactly once per lease window.
Measured and printed: wall time and actions per second. Invoked by tests/db/run.sh only (disposable database)."""
