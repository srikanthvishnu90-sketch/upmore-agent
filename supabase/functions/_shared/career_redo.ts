// REQS DOC 1 (Q83, Q196): a frustrated reply or "that's not what I asked", with nothing else in the message, answered by
// code: one line that owns the miss, what the last answer was taken as (from the record: the last reply's intent and the
// search it ran, never a guess), and one question that lets the person say what they wanted in a few words. Before this,
// these messages got the router's catch-all ("I'm not sure which part of your search that's about"), which reads as not
// listening. A message that carries the real ask after the complaint ("not what I asked, I want marketing roles") is the
// router's, which already re-runs on it; so is "that's wrong", which the router reads as a correction. Read only: nothing
// is changed, sent or undone here.
