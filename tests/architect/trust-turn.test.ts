// REQS DOC 1 (conversation and trust): the questions a person asks about Trainee itself are answered from what is true,
// never with the "I may have missed what you meant" banner and never with a confident wrong route. Items: Q33 (what it
// is), Q234/Q239/Q244 (privacy promise, never sold, what is stored), Q235 (what it can see and holds, from the person's
// own rows), Q202 (legal, tax and medical questions get a referral), Q84/Q127 (a thanks or a laugh gets a short reply).
// Outcome assertions on meaning (kind, the facts a reply rests on), not on exact wording.
// Review of #354 (R1-R7) each has its own test below.
