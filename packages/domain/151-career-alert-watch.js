/* Career alert watch loop (ALERT G1, BUG-090; Spec 2 job-detection/alerts).
   THE STANDING CALLER module 121 never had. 121's engine (poll / diffNew / scoreFit)
   detects new postings in ~2ms of processing, but in the product it was only ever invoked
   on demand (the chat router when a user asks; the gauntlet harness in tests) — detection
   was a capability, "alerts the moment it posts" was not a behavior. This module is the
   watch cycle as product code at harness/host tier: the deployed host schedules
   runWatchCycle() on 121's POLL_MINUTES cadence (starred 15 min / default 60 min) and
   supplies the real fetch, the per-user snapshot store, the scoring profile and the
   delivery sink. Scheduling and the delivery channel itself are HOST concerns and are
   deliberately NOT in this module (see docs/career/alert-watch.md).

   One cycle:
     (a) loads the prior snapshot/seen-set from the injected store,
     (b) calls 121's public poll() — its real fetch/dedupe/diffNew code path, fixture or
         live feeds arriving through 121's own opts.fetch seam,
     (c) for each genuinely-new posting applies the G6 GATE (the poll path in 121 has no
         level/family gate of its own — a manager posting scored Reach 13 live on
         2026-10-13 and would have alerted): alert ONLY when
         seniority_band in {intern, new_grad} AND role_family is in the profile's watched
         families AND 121 scoreFit does not hard-exclude the posting,
     (d) composes a typed ALERT RECORD and hands it to the injected sink,
     (e) the new snapshot/seen-set is persisted by 121 poll() itself (same store + key);
         removals are counted silently — a closed posting never alerts,
     (f) returns a typed cycle result; a board failure degrades THAT board only and
         never kills the cycle (G7: a per-board hard deadline is imposed here, at the
         watch level, around the injected fetch — a drip-feeding board is cut off and
         named in errors[]).
   First cycle against an empty store is a SEED cycle: it establishes the baseline
   snapshot and alerts on nothing (the postings it sees are not new to the world, only
   to us). Pass alertOnSeed:true to override. Delivery is a sink call, nothing more:
   what the sink does (chat message, push, file) is the host's decision, and the
   approval law for anything beyond alerting the user is unchanged.
   Pure-ish domain idiom like its neighbours: all I/O arrives injected
   { feeds?, fetch, profile, store, sink, now }. */
