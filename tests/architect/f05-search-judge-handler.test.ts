// FEATURE 5 (2026-10-25): job search that ranks by fit and explains it, proven through the production handler.
// A person's texts go through handleChat (supabase/functions/agent-chat/handler-career.ts) unchanged, on a real Postgres
// (CI's migration order) with the real supabase-js client; the only seams are the HTTP hop to the Supabase project
// (tests/flow/postgrest.ts) and the HTTP hop to the model provider, answered here by a fake OpenAI that judges by a rule the
// test sets. The postings are fake rows in career_postings (the live board) and career_kb_postings (the saved snapshot).
//
//   (s) the live board empty: the list comes from the snapshot, and the reply says so and how old it is
//   (l) the live board has a match: the list is the live postings, ranked by fit, with how fresh they are; the judge off,
//       no model call is made and the reply says the list was not judged; several phrasings land the same way
//   (j) CAREER_JUDGE=on: the top N judged on the fixed scale with grounded one-line reasons; the accounting is a coverage
//       fraction; weak/no are dropped; the call is metered (agent_turn_costs); the same ask again is answered from the
//       cache with no new model call; "apply to these" means exactly the postings listed
//   (g) a reason that names something not in the posting or the person's facts is not kept: that posting is "not judged"
//   (f) the model failing: the fit order stands and the reply says the judge did not answer
//   (p) "judge prompt: ..." is kept as a standing instruction and goes to the judge with the next search
//
// Run: CI=true deno test -A --no-check [--import-map=tests/flow/supabase-npm.json] tests/architect/f05-search-judge-handler.test.ts
