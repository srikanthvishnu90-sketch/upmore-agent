// FEATURE 4 unit tests: the bullet rewrite (_shared/career_tailor_rewrite.ts) with a fake model. A faithful rewrite
// passes; an invented metric, employer, tool, or claimed role is refused bullet by bullet with its reason and the original
// kept; the rewritten resume passes 123's truth audit and renders to PDF through 123/148 exactly as the router renders;
// a model failure or an unreadable answer leaves the select-and-reorder resume; the flag is off by default.
