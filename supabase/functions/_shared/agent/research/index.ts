// The open-question pipeline (flag CAREER_KNOWLEDGE): understand -> ground -> write -> guard. One call per question:
//   understand  Person Context Pack + message -> field, stage, place, question type, at most ONE question (understand.ts)
//   ground      cached, capped OpenAI web search -> guard-accepted facts with URLs (ground.ts, guard.ts)
//   write       the research brief file, built from those facts, labelled general knowledge and the person's own facts (brief.ts)
//   guard       any number or name no source accounts for is dropped by code; the chat paragraph is linted (chat.ts)
// The brief is delivered through `publish`: in production file_publisher.ts files it as #280's `research_brief` kind. Without
// `publish` the markdown is returned for the caller and the reply carries no link.
