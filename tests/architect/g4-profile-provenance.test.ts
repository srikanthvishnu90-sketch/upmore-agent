// G4 review (coordinator, 2026-10-24): the server prepare's real profile reader. The connected flow (flow-connected.test.ts)
// hands prepareAhead a profile built by hand, so it never runs storedProfile (workers/career-browser/prepare-ahead.ts),
// which reads what the chat stored in agent_flow_state. Here the profile is written by the chat's own writers and stored
// the way the chat stores it, on a real Postgres:
//   brain   career_tools.ts confirm_profile_fact with its event recorded: confirmed, with the owner's provenance and the
//           confirmation event (WO-102 evidence)                                           -> trusted
//   brain   the same tool when the event could not be recorded: confirmed, nothing stamped  -> never trusted
//   router  CareerProfile.confirmFact (122, the router path): confirmed, no event            -> never trusted
//   brain   confirmed with its event, then corrected (correct_profile_fact): a draft again, still carrying the old
//           event (updateFact merges the correction)                                       -> never trusted
//   draft   read from the resume, never confirmed                                          -> never trusted
//   legacy  a fact with no status, no confirmation and no provenance (a shape a reader meets) -> never trusted
// and each person's threads hold more than one profile: an older thread's, and a row claiming another owner.
// What is checked is what prepareAhead hands on: the facts file the engine is given (judged by the engine's own
// trustedManifest, as scripts/apply.ts does), the resume it prints (the renderer's own input, line by line with the facts
// each line cites), and what the cover-letter drafter's model is given. The engine is a stub that reads the facts file and
// stops on a cover-letter question; nothing opens a page.
