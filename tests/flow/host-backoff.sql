-- REFERENCE ONLY: loaded into the throwaway test databases (tests/architect/mass-scale-pg.test.ts, mass-submit-pg.test.ts),
-- never into a live project. It is the exact shape of the Request to the database lane (builder A) for mass submission at
-- scale (owner, 2026-10-27 19:52 and 19:55 CDT): many worker instances against one database, fair leased claims that are
-- reclaimed when an instance dies, and each employer host's refusals shared by every instance. A migration that ships
-- this replaces this file in the tests.
--
-- 1. A lease before the drive. A claim leases queued applications (lease_token, lease_until) without starting them:
--    state stays 'queued', attempts stays 0. The worker begins a leased one right before its engine starts
--    (career_apply_lease_begin: queued -> driving, attempts = 1, only under its own live lease). An instance that dies
--    before beginning loses nothing: its leases lapse and any instance claims those applications again. One that dies
--    after beginning is swept to unknown_outcome and never driven again (attempts = 1), as today.
-- 2. Fair across people. Each claim takes at most one application per person, walking people in user id order from a
--    random point (a loose index scan, no window over the queue, no global lock): one person with 5,000 queued never
--    holds back the next person's first. FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED: concurrent claims never wait on each other.
-- 3. Host refusals, shared. career_apply_host_backoff holds, per employer host, until when every instance waits before
--    starting there again, written when a host refuses (429, 503 Retry-After, a verification check) and cleared by the next
--    success. Bounded per call; one small row per host; no number of ours (as long as the host asked, else 30 s doubling,
--    asked again at least every hour).

-- person by the gap before their id, and with small claims a person just after a close neighbour would wait for many laps:
-- measured, a first start only after 199,850 others.) No shared cursor row: each instance keeps its own.
