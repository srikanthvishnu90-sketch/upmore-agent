-- The job-alerts schedule (WO-007b): pg_cron calls career-proactive through pg_net every 5 minutes with the
-- CAREER_PROACTIVE_SECRET header. The secret lives in Vault and is read at call time, so it never appears in the job text, a
-- command line or this file. Run by the OWNER only, after the migration and the function deploy:
--   CAREER_PROACTIVE_SECRET=... psql "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" -v url=https://<ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/career-proactive -f scripts/launch/schedule-career-proactive.sql
-- The same secret must be set on the function (supabase secrets set CAREER_PROACTIVE_SECRET=...).
-- Re-running replaces the job and the secret. Health: select * from career_proactive_runs order by run_at desc limit 5;
-- no row in the last 30 minutes means alerts are down.
