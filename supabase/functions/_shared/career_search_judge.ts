// FEATURE 5 (2026-10-25): job search that ranks by fit and explains it, on the live path.
//
// Before this, "find me data analyst jobs in Chicago" reached only the regex router's discovery, which scores the 600
// newest rows of the frozen career_kb_postings snapshot; searchPostings (career_search.ts: fitOf, goalScore, titleTier)
// over career_postings was reachable only by the brain, which is pinned off (DIAGNOSIS 2.9). This module is what the
// production handler calls after the router has decided a turn is a role search:
//
//   1. Source. The live board (career_postings) when it holds an open posting that matches; else the saved snapshot
//      (career_kb_postings), read by the asked role and place, plus the turn's snapshot window. The reply says which,
//      and how fresh: "From 37 live postings that match, first seen in the last 6 days."
//   2. Pre-filter. searchPostings ranks the matches by title, goal and fit to the person's CONFIRMED facts; the top N
//      (default 20) go on.
//   3. Judge (CAREER_JUDGE=on only, metered by the caller, cached per posting and profile hash). One model call rates
//      every uncached posting on the scale below with a one-line reason. Code keeps a verdict only when it is on the
//      scale and its reason names nothing that is not in the posting or the person's confirmed facts; anything else is
//      "not judged", with why. Off, failed or unanswered, the list is the fit order and the reply says it was not judged.
//   4. Account. "18/20 judged; 6 strong, 5 fair; 7 dropped as weak/no", every posting not judged with its reason.
//
// The person's own judge instructions ("judge prompt: ..."), kept as a standing instruction (career:standing, wiped by
// an erase), go to the judge with every search. They can shape a verdict, never the grounding rule or the scale.
// Nothing here sends, applies or writes anywhere but the person's own cache and standing instructions.
