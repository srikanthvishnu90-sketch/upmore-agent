// P8 (Depth Lane D, 2026-10-16) — the frozen gauntlet probe, verbatim:
//   t1 "let me know the second any new grad data roles open up in Chicago"
//   t2 "yes, set that up for me"
// On v223 both turns fell to the generic fallback live. The seam showed
// why, in three layers: (1) 142's create-watch dispatch regexes only knew
// the manual's dialect ("watch for", "alert me when") — "let me know …
// open up" matched nothing; (2) watchRoleFromText resolved roles only by
// curated title terms, and nobody's ask says "data analyst roles" — they
// say "data roles"; (3) a bare affirmation had no handler at all, so the
// confirmation turn could only fall back. The fix is chat-layer only
// (142's dispatch + role aliases + a recency-gated, read-only affirm
// handler) and is NOT deployed by this lane — it rides the branch for the
// owner's deploy tap. These tests pin, through the career_host seam:
//   P8 verbatim, profile on file -> t1 CREATES the Data Analyst watch
//   (Chicago, new_grad), t2 confirms it from the saved record and creates
//   nothing twice; P8 verbatim with NO profile -> t1 reaches the watch
//   intent's own profile gate (its honest reply), never the generic
//   fallback; a stray affirmation with no recent watch falls through.
// Fail-first: on the base commit all three P8 assertions fail (fallback).
// Check: node --test tests/career-p8-watch-phrasing.test.cjs
