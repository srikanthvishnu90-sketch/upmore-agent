// from career_alerts.ts, the outbox written once per key, and each person's counters saved. Counters: alerts sent count
// against the person's local day (reset when their date changes); held postings are kept until a report carries them;
// last_checked_at moves to this run, so a posting is alerted at most once.
// WO-037, enforced here rather than trusted from the plan: an alert is queued only if its posting passes the person's
// own gate again at the moment of queuing (matchPosting: their keywords, place and relevance floor; and news, not
// backlog), so nothing below the person's threshold is ever sent; the planner holds no alert for a weekly count (but see the
// database's career_alert_enqueue, which still does). Each alert carries its posting's first_seen_at, for the latency report.
