// #354 safety follow-up (2026-11-01): one distress detector for every path. The trust turn's own list missed 25 of 46
// phrasings ("kms", "i took too many pills", "i have a plan to end it", "unalive myself" ...), and the router's crisis
// screen (125 respondToRequest) missed them too, so the person got the "I may have missed what you meant" fallback.
// The detector now lives once, in packages/domain/139-career-safety.js (CareerSafety.isDistress), and the trust turn,
// 125's request screen, 139's distress protocol and the router's first check all call it.
//
// Policy (documented in 139-career-safety.js): a false alarm costs one kind check-in, a miss can cost a life, so an
// ambiguous message ("i'd kill myself if i bombed it", "i'm not suicidal just tired") gets the check-in. Only idioms that
// are plainly about work or about something else ("this job is killing me", "kill it in the interview", "career suicide",
// "my career is dead in the water", "12 kms from the office") are left to the router.
