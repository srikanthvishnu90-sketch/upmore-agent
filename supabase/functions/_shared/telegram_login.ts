// FEATURE 16 (owner decision, 2026-10-26, in writing): a Telegram chat is linked to a Trainee account with Telegram's own
// login (the login_url button / Login Widget), never with a code typed into the chat.
//
// Telegram signs what it tells the web page (https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login#checking-authorization, ASSUMED from
// the documented algorithm; the official page did not load from the build environment): the fields it sends (id,
// first_name, last_name, username, photo_url, auth_date) except `hash`, sorted by name, as "name=value" lines joined by
// "\n", are the data-check string; `hash` is the hex HMAC-SHA-256 of that string keyed with SHA-256(bot token). A payload
// is taken only when the hash matches (compared in constant time) and auth_date is at most LOGIN_MAX_AGE_S old and not in
// the future. The database then takes each signed payload once (channel_telegram_link_as, the replay refusal).
