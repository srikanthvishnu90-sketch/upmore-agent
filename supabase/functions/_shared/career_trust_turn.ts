// REQS DOC 1 (conversation and trust, 2026-10-31): the plain questions a person asks about Trainee itself, answered by
// code before the router, from what is true: what Trainee is, what happens to their own information, what it can see
// and holds for them, and that a personal legal, tax or medical question belongs with a professional. Each one fell to
// the router's "I may have missed what you meant" banner on trunk (or worse: a tax question about a bonus got the
// negotiation script, and "am I talking to a real person" got "that is not on your record").
//
//   identity       "are you a bot?", "am I talking to a real person?": Trainee is an AI career agent, not a person.
//   privacy_sell   "do you sell my data?", "who can see my messages?": only what the privacy policy says
//                  (docs/launch/legal-pages/privacy.template.html; tests/architect/trust-turn.test.ts derives the list of
//                  services from the policy text and checks every claim there).
//   privacy_store  "what do you keep about me?": the categories the policy names, then what is actually saved for this
//                  person right now (deps.stored), and what "forget everything" really erases (career_host.js erase,
//                  handler-career.ts tailored resumes, career_erase_messages for the chat messages).
//   access         "can you see my other apps / my email?": every connection on the person's account (deps.connections,
//                  user_oauth_connections), plus what Trainee holds for them; a read that failed is said, never guessed.
//   referral       a personal legal, tax or medical question: a professional's call, never a confident guess. A job search
//                  in those fields, work authorization, an offer or negotiation question, and distress are left alone.
//   ack            a whole-message thanks or laugh: one short word back, nothing changed (meta.ack lets a channel show it
//                  as a reaction instead). Never "ok", "yes", "cool" or a thumbs-up: those can answer a card.
//
// Every kind but ack answers only when the whole message is that question: a message that also asks for something else
// ("is my data safe? find me jobs") goes on to the router, so the rest is never dropped. No model, no send, no write.
