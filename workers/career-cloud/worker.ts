// to the person's own computer; D-022: unlocked in code only by the gate in the database).
//
// A long-running Deno process. It claims approved applications for anyone who turned the cloud on, through one door:
// career_apply_cloud_claim (20261021080000_career_apply_cloud.sql), which refuses every job whose portal family has not
// passed the gate (3 hand submissions confirmed by the employer's email), whose person has not said yes in chat, whose
// portal or person is paused, or that is over the person's daily limit or a second one to the same company in 30 days.
//
// Each claimed job runs the same engine as the person's own computer (scripts/apply.ts --submit --approved <hash>),
// headless, in its own process, so its own browser and its own fresh context: cookies and storage never cross people.
// The answers are rebuilt from the approved payload alone (approve-first's factsFromPayload) and, with the approved
// resume fetched for this job only, written to a private temp folder (0700, files 0600) that is removed in finally,
// whatever happens. The engine submits only if the application is still exactly the approved one.
//
// A verification check (a captcha) at open, review or Submit is never solved or got around: the job goes back to the
// person with its link ("finish this one yourself"), and the check counts in the telemetry, which pauses a portal or a
// person before failures pile up under their name.
