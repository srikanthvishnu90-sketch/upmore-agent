// Option A (chosen 2026-10-22 under the owner's delegation): a text yes never approves or sends; only the person's tap
// on the exact payload does. The card is the only cloud authorization route (C9). While the cloud card is the thread's
// last word, a yes only OPENS that card: it is read back as the person (career_apply_message_card_read_own) and the
// reply points them to its Approve button, with the card's id so the app can open it. The binding is minted only by the
// person's tap on the exact hash-bound card (career_apply_message_card_approve_own -> cloud_tap, 20261024130000), never
// from here. This module holds no approve, begin, enqueue, claim or finish call: its store has no method that could
// make one.
//
// It answers only when all of these hold, else the turn goes on as before:
//   - an explicit yes ("ok", "sure" and "y" are too easily a reply to something else);
//   - the thread's last word is the cloud card itself (career_apply_message_cloud_card_show_as writes it with intent
//     career_message_approval and the card's id), so the yes is about that card and no other;
//   - the turn runs on the person's own session (a texting channel's service-role turn is left alone: F-037's work).
