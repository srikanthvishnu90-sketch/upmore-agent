/* Career portal apply — CA-03 sandbox leg (Spec 2 §6.1 pipeline + §6.3
   browser rules, enforced as code, not prompts).
   What this module IS: the portal driver for the apply family. It drives a
   hosted application form through a page-adapter ("board") seam — analyze
   the form, fill it from CONFIRMED profile facts only, stop ON the final
   review screen (the doorstep) with an exact would-submit payload snapshot,
   and submit ONLY on an explicit owner approval, exactly once, with
   timeout -> needs_human reconciliation (§8.3). §6.3 rules are hard code:
     - employer-hosted forms on TESTED ATS families only (Greenhouse,
       Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters); LinkedIn / Indeed apply automation
       is refused by construction (AGGREGATOR_APPLY_FORBIDDEN);
     - one isolated session per user; a session refuses any other user;
     - a captcha / verification code at any point STOPS the run and hands
       the user the link to finish the last step (CAPTCHA_HANDOFF) — this
       module contains no solver call and no disguise technique, ever;
       the one exception (WO-096) is the code the application system
       EMAILS the person: for a drive the person approved on its card,
       runApplyWithEmailCode reads it from their own Gmail (read-only,
       with their Google consent) and fills it, then stops at the doorstep
       for the person's own Submit (D-029 rule 5: nothing is pressed);
       otherwise the run stops EMAIL_CODE_REQUIRED naming their next step;
     - legal attestation fields are never auto-answered; they need the
       user's explicit per-run confirmation. EEO defaults to
       "Decline to self-identify" unless the user chose otherwise (§6.1).
   What this module is NOT: a browser. The board seam is the page adapter;
   in this build two boards exist — createSandboxBoard below (a faithful
   Greenhouse-shaped hosted form over a LOCAL receipt sink, labeled
   SANDBOX/TEST, following the 133 makeTestBoard / F3 form-driver pattern)
   and the module-150 Playwright driver (packages/domain/
   150-career-portal-browser.js), which drives REAL hosted forms to the
   doorstep. Its submit leg is ARMED-ONLY (BUG-063 / lane defect D3): a
   browser board transmits only when submitDoorstep below arms it from
   an approval that carries the owner's batch approval reference
   (approval.approvalRef) on top of approvedByUser — approval alone, or
   a board constructed armed for the test lane, are the only other
   paths, and an unarmed board's submit() throws REAL_SUBMIT_DISABLED.
   Since MI-116 the approval must also carry the doorstep's payload
   hash (approval.payloadSha256): submitDoorstep re-builds the
   would-submit payload from the board's CURRENT answers and refuses
   APPROVAL_PAYLOAD_MISMATCH before arming if any value changed, any
   field gained an answer, or any answer was cleared since approval
   (Spec 2 §10 — changing a payload after approval invalidates it).
   The §6.3 host gate is enforced on EVERY navigation hop (BUG-060 /
   D1): a redirect off the allowlist surfaces from the driver as a typed
   HOST_REDIRECT_REFUSED stop, and a board exposing zero fillable fields
   is a typed EMPTY_FORM stop, never a doorstep (BUG-061 / D2).
   classifyTarget can recognize a real ATS URL, but runApply refuses
   any board that is neither a registered sandbox board nor the attested
   browser driver (REAL_PORTAL_NOT_WIRED). Account-walled boards
   (Workday/iCIMS/Taleo) and the owner's signed-in session remain future,
   owner-gated work — see docs/career/board-automation-map.md.
   Caps (§6.4) are the owner's DECIDED numbers (15/day locked 2026-10-12;
   5/vendor/day; 1/company/30 days) and are ENFORCED here (MI-110): a run
   or submit that would exceed one stops CAP_REACHED naming the cap and
   the count, counted from the submissions ledger this module writes;
   the never-twice-to-the-same-job rule (§8.3) is enforced alongside.
   That ledger never contained the user's own hand-filed applications,
   so the never-twice rule also reads what the host knows — tracker
   rows and user statements passed as manualApplications — and a match
   on the same canonical job stops ALREADY_APPLIED_BY_USER naming the
   source of the knowledge (MI-108 / G3), at the doorstep and again at
   click time.

  // It READS destination state (employer-side status readers) and
  // records every attempt on the record; it NEVER submits anything —
  // there is no submit path in this function. Design note (contract
  // mi-115): Spec 2 §8.3 says check the user's email first, but the
  // inbox half is NOT_WIRED — Gmail is not connected in-product
  // (MI-074 / CA-08b). An `inboxScan` seam is accepted; when it is
  // absent the attempt RECORDS inbox_unavailable instead of pretending
  // to have checked. A "submitted" claim counts only with the
  // employer's own confirmation ID attached (the BUG-208 lesson: an
  // ID-less claim is not proof). Anything unproven stays unknown and
  // gains a named userQuestion — re-presented, never silently dropped.
