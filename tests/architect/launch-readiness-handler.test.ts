// Launch readiness fixes (audit PR #192, 2026-10-26) at the REAL handler (handleChat) on real Postgres, with a fake
// model on the OpenAI wire (no key, no spend: the provider's URL is answered in-process and every request is counted).
// Every step asserts what the database holds (or what requests were made), then that the reply is true to it.
//   X7  the per-person daily model ceiling: over it no model request is made and no cost is recorded, the router answers,
//       and the reply says today's limit was reached; under it the model answers and the cost is recorded; yesterday's
//       spend and another person's spend do not count; the call ceiling holds; a spend that cannot be read is no call.
//   R1  two texts sent close together are both answered, in the order they arrived; nothing is lost to a conflict.
//   B1  a refused save (a conflict after a tool already wrote) says only what is true: the answer was not saved, what the tool
//       already saved stays (the database holds it), nothing was sent; B2 the gate is per thread (p_thread sent, other thread not held)
//   C1  a card yes whose save is refused: the reply says the approved applications are queued (career_apply_jobs holds them)
//   D1  a double-tapped send (the same turn key twice, forced to overlap) waits for the first and is replayed
//   X3  the postings pool is read only on a turn that uses it: not for "hi", not for a code-first turn.
//   S3  text inside a posting the brain reads never becomes a standing instruction; the person's own words still do.
//   Q2  the apply reply says what will happen with the workers deployed: without the server's prepare, the extension.
