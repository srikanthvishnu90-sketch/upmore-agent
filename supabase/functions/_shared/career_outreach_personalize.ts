// PERSONALIZED OUTREACH (2026-10-31, owner priority): every outreach message reads as written by the person for that one
// recipient, from sourced facts only. Code builds the plan and enforces it; the model only writes the sentences.
//   a. Recipient brief: only SOURCED facts about the recipient (their row, a company or team page, a paper, a talk, a post
//      the person pasted, SEC EDGAR, the person's own LinkedIn export or Gmail correspondents). Every fact carries
//      source_kind + retrieved_at; a fact without them, from a refused site (LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, Glassdoor pages;
//      the person's own export FILE is fine), dated in the future, or reading as an instruction ("ignore previous ...")
//      is dropped and never reaches the model.
//   b. Sender brief: the person's CONFIRMED facts only (D-007; career_outreach.ts confirmed()).
//   c. Overlap: shared school, hometown, past employer, the recipient's current firm, an interest, a mutual connection,
//      or a piece of the recipient's work the person can genuinely reference (they pasted it, or it is on a topic in
//      their own confirmed facts).
//   d. Field playbooks are data (outreach_playbooks.ts): structure, length norm, the asks allowed, when a referral is
//      warranted, follow-up cadence and timing.
//   e. One ask sized to the relationship: a referral only to someone the person already knows (warm) AND for a named role,
//      and only where the playbook allows it.
//   f. The quality gate REJECTS a draft that is generic (the swap test: put another recipient's name on it and it would
//      still be true of them), that carries any unsourced claim about either side (career_outreach.ts outreachLock, with
//      the brief's facts as the recipient's sources, plus "your paper/talk/deal on X" checked against the brief), that is
//      over the field's length norm, that has no ask or more than one, or whose ask is not the one planned.
// Nothing here sends: the draft goes to the same approval card with its exact payload (career_outreach.ts), and sending
// stays the person's own channel.
