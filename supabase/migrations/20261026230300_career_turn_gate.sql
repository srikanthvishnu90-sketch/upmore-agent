-- Launch readiness R1 (2026-10-26): two texts sent close together are both answered, in the order they arrived.
--
-- Each inbound text runs its own agent-chat turn. Two turns for one person read the same thread revision, and the second
-- to commit got revision_conflict from career_host_commit; chatThroughAgent threw on the 409, and the person read
-- "I couldn't answer that just now" for a message that was already claimed and never retried.
--
-- The fix: a conversation's turns run one at a time, in the order agent-chat received them. Each turn takes a ticket
-- (career_turn_gate_enter) before it reads the thread, waits until no earlier live ticket of the same person and thread remains
-- (career_turn_gate_ready), and gives its ticket back after it commits (career_turn_gate_leave). A ticket lapses after
-- its lease (a crashed turn never blocks the next one for longer than that). Service role only: agent-chat calls these
-- with its own key for every turn, the person's app never does.
-- Idempotent. Tested by tests/db/career_turn_gate.test.sql and, end to end, tests/architect/launch-readiness-handler.test.ts.
