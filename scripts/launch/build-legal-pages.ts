// filled. The templates live outside site/ (docs/launch/legal-pages/*.template.html), so nothing with a placeholder is
// ever served. This build:
//   1. reads the owner's inputs (docs/launch/legal-pages/owner-inputs.json, or --inputs <file>) and refuses, naming each
//      one, while any is missing, empty or not the right shape (SUPPORT_EMAIL must be one email address);
//   2. fills the templates and refuses, naming it, if ANY placeholder or template note is left in what it would write: a
//      {{PLACEHOLDER}}, a [Bracketed instruction], or a note such as "Template. Only publish claims...". The homepage's
//      unfinished sections are removed or rewritten to what is true (patchHome); none is filled with an invented fact;
//   3. writes privacy.html, terms.html and google.html (the pre-consent notice, from _shared/google_scopes.ts
//      consentNotice) and the homepage with its legal links pointed at them (index.html), into site/ or --out <dir>.
// Run: deno run -A scripts/launch/build-legal-pages.ts [--inputs file.json] [--out dir]
