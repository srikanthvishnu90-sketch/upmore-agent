# Upmore: all 256 capability contracts

Companion to [the top-to-bottom audit](upmore-capability-audit.md). Generated from the current catalog plus individually authored acceptance criteria on October 8, 2026. These criteria are proposed requirements, not assertions that tests already passed.

**How to read this:** “Current” is the `AGENT_BUILD` declaration, defaulting to planned. It is not a live verification grade. Each area specifies its required data connectors and action rails; each feature adds a distinct implementation/acceptance contract. A read-only feature needs correct inputs, rule logic and evidence; a prepare feature needs a complete reviewed draft; an executing feature additionally needs consent, idempotency, reconciliation and a receipt. Every feature inherits tenant isolation, freshness, coverage, user correction, and safe failure requirements from the main audit.

Declared counts: gated: 8, live: 1, planned: 190, prepare: 23, read: 34. All 30 cancellation merchant playbooks remain unverified; the live cancellation declaration does not mean merchant execution is available.

**Release rule:** publish supported institutions/providers, jurisdiction, history coverage and read/prepare/execute mode. Unsupported connectors must yield an honest limitation or handoff. A deep link is not submission, an application is not approval, a payment request is not payment, and expected savings are not confirmed savings.
