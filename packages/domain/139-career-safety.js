/* Career safety & honesty guards (T-80 kill switch, T-82 distress protocol, OUTE-007/008 decided caps +
   suppression, Doc 1 §9 / Doc 2 §5.3 refusals, truthful AI-use answers). Pure, no I/O, UMD like the
   other domain modules. These are the rails that must REFUSE well: a burst send, a fake referral, and
   taking an assessment for the user are never executed — each refusal names the why and offers the
   honest alternative. Suppression is severity-1: once a person opts out, no code path in this module
   lets them back into a send list. The kill switch halts every queue and resolves any in-flight item
   to a definite state — a send is either provider-confirmed sent, or it is not sent; never half-sent. */

  // ---------- Distress detector: THE one list (#354 safety follow-up, 2026-11-01) ----------
  // Every path reads this: the trust turn (supabase/functions/_shared/career_trust_turn.ts), 125's request screen
  // (respondToRequest), this module's distress protocol and the router's first check (142 handleChat / dispatchChat).
  // Four separate lists each missed what another caught ("kms", "i took too many pills", "i have a plan to end it").
  //
  // POLICY. A false alarm costs one kind check-in; a miss can cost a life. So a message that MIGHT be about ending one's
  // life or self-harm gets the check-in, hyperbole included ("i'd kill myself if i bombed it", "i'm not suicidal, just
  // tired"). Only idioms that are plainly about work or about something else stay with the router, and each is named
  // below (BENIGN, or a pattern's own guard): "this job is killing me", "kill it in the interview", "career suicide",
  // "my career is dead in the water", "i'll die on this hill", "12 kms from the office", "end it with a strong closing
  // line", "take my life in a new direction". Frustration without self-harm words ("this market is brutal", "i'm a
  // failure") is not a crisis here: 125's own support line answers the second.
  //
  // This list is the deterministic layer. In agent-chat a second layer runs beside it on every inbound message: OpenAI's
  // moderation endpoint (self-harm, self-harm/intent, self-harm/instructions; supabase/functions/_shared/career_crisis_screen.ts).
  // Either layer flagging gives the crisis reply; a moderation error or timeout leaves this list's answer, never a block.
  // Re-review of #354 (2026-11-01) widened it: method and lethality questions, any overdose or count of pills (named
  // drugs too), "off my balcony", rope and noose, a weapon on oneself, cutting and burning, worthlessness ("don't deserve
  // to live"), not existing or not waking up, "time to end it", and core Spanish, French and German phrases.
  //
  // How it reads: lower case, curly quotes straightened, apostrophes dropped (dont / don't, im / i'm read the same),
  // "2" between words read as "to"; the message is split into clauses at . ! ? , ; : and new lines, the benign idioms
  // are cut out of each clause, and each clause is tested on its own (so "$" below means the end of a clause).
