// Item 14: an employer's reply (interview, rejection, offer) moves the application it is about. The applications Trainee
// sends carry no title (the cloud card's payload has a closed key set without one, 20261024130000), so the mail run
// must take the posting's own title, as the confirmation run already does (career_apply_confirm.ts). Without a role:
// a hand-tracked application at the same employer is dropped as a "duplicate" of Trainee's, and a rejection for that
// other job marks Trainee's application Rejected. And a sent application is dated when it was sent (claimed_at), not when
// its row was last touched. Driven through the real supabaseMailStore over a fake PostgREST client that returns only
// the columns the store selects. Synthetic employer and person only; no network, no database, no model.
