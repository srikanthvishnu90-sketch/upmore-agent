// Launch readiness R1 (2026-10-26): a person's chat turns run one at a time, in the order agent-chat received them
// (20261026230300_career_turn_gate.sql). Two texts sent close together used to run two turns on the same thread
// revision; the second to commit was refused with revision_conflict and the person read "I couldn't answer that just now".
//
// enterTurnGate takes a ticket before the turn reads its thread and waits until the person's earlier turns have
// committed (or their tickets lapsed). The gate never blocks a turn for good:
//   - a ticket lapses after its lease (LEASE_SECONDS), so a crashed turn holds the next one for at most that long;
//   - after WAIT_MS the turn goes ahead anyway (career_host_commit still refuses a stale write, and the channel's
//     chatThroughAgent retries that once with a fresh read);
//   - if the gate itself cannot be read (the migration not applied yet, a failed call), the turn goes ahead as before.
// leave() gives the ticket back; the handler calls it after the commit, on every path.
