// WO-025 (architect): the text mock interview and the pre-interview brief. A mock starts with one text, scores every
// answer with 127's rubric, nudges in one line and ends in a debrief that quotes only the person's words. Company
// questions and company facts come only from a record on file, quoted with their source label; with no record nothing
// is said about the company. "stop" alone is the carrier's word and never a mock command or answer.
// Run: deno test -A --no-check tests/architect/wo-025-mock.test.ts
