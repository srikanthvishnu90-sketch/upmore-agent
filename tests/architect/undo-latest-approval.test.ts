// C21 / C22 (behavior map; spec 16 "reversal symmetry"): "undo" / "cancel that" right after an approval resolves against
// the LATEST thing the person approved and is answered from the database in one line:
//   - an application still queued (not yet claimed by a worker) is cancelled: the row ends not_submitted, nothing went out;
//   - one being sent, or already sent, is said plainly, with what can still be done; nothing is claimed;
//   - the email(s) one approval covered and the send rail has not claimed are withdrawn (approved -> skipped, which the
//     rail's claim turns into a cancelled send); one already out is said to be out;
//   - a second "undo" says "already cancelled" and never reaches an older approval; another person's rows are never read;
//   - when the conversation moved on after the approval ("undo that" about a newer act), the turn is not this one's.
// Through the REAL handler (handleChat) on a real Postgres 16 with every migration; outcomes asserted on career_apply_jobs and
// career_outreach_drafts. Fail-first on trunk 5d6857219: "undo" is not read by any code turn (intent is the router's), and
// every row is left as it was (the queued application would still go out).
