// Every per-person secret Upmore puts in Supabase Vault has a way out when the person deletes their account (megadoc
// Q04; privacy policy: "deleting your account erases ... your bank/brokerage connections including stored
// credentials"). The Vault has no foreign keys, so a cascade never reaches it: each writer below is declared with the
// path that removes its secret, and a new vault.create_secret in a migration fails this test until it is declared here.
// Found 2026-10-12: the Gmail token (oauth_gmail_<uid>) had no path out at all.
// Check: node --test tests/vault-deletion.test.cjs
