/* Career doorstep — the chat ACTION seam (repair lane R3, gauntlet C15/C17/C18/C20/C37).
   One seam pattern for every action in this module:
     user turn -> routed action (handleChat) -> a domain module or the F3 form
     driver executes -> the result carries a typed resultStatus (the canonical
     oracle set: completed | prepared | awaiting_user | running | partial |
     blocked | failed | unknown_outcome) plus structured proof the composer /
     grader can read.
   What lives here (and ONLY here, per lane ownership):
     1. DOORSTEP FORM SEAM (C17/C18, C20 pre-submit): fills the F3 replica
        forms step by step through the fixture form driver — values resolved
        from profile facts only, conditional fields handled, unknowns and
        consent/declaration answers surfaced as ASKS (never guessed, never
        inferred — sensitive answers least of all), the hidden-default stop
        honored (UNRESOLVED_HIDDEN_DEFAULT is the terminal step, not a
        surprise at submit) — and stops ON the final review screen. Product
        output is the doorstep proof chain: step log (field, value source,
        result per agent step), a would-submit payload snapshot (all values +
        sha256 of the bound resume artifact + sha256 of the payload), and a
        sink-armed verification: a dry validation of the exact payload against
        the driver (missing fields, hidden defaults, late material) with NO
        submission.
     2. C20 SUBMIT LEG: after the doorstep, the case's own approved in-sink
        submit runs through this same seam. Exactly one submit per payload;
        a sink timeout is reported as unknown_outcome (never as success);
        "did it go through?" reconciles the sink BEFORE any retry, and a
        repeat approval while an outcome is unknown/confirmed is refused.
     3. QUEUE CONTROL (C37 + R-A4): "stop everything" halts the outreach queue and
        PERSISTS the halt (the queue state is the host-persisted object /
        JSON file passed in ctx; the halt flag and per-item status are
        written into it). R-A4 (S0): the halt ALWAYS sets a global user
        pause (ctx.globalPause + state.global_pause + q.global_pause) —
        when the queue state can't be read the pause is set anyway and the
        reply states the exact counts are unverified, never a no-op. Duplicate events (same event_id) are deduped and
        out-of-order events (older sent_at than the state they would rewind)
        cannot revive a halted item. Pending recipients are also suppressed
        through 124's own suppression store when the host passes one, so a
        send-time check in 124 would stop them too. 124 is CALLED, never edited.
     4. PACKET BINDING LEG (C15): packet preparation via chat resolves the
        requested artifact version among same-named records by CONTENT HASH
        and calls 133's assemblePacket (called, never edited); the returned
        packet carries this seam's binding + review surface.
   Approval gates are untouched: sensitive/consent answers still stop for the
   user, submits still require the case's explicit approval turn, caps are
   124's and are not touched here. All form writes go only to the F3 local
   receipt sink. No real sends, no real submissions.
     5. EXECUTION GUARDS + TRUTHFUL STATUS (repair lane R2B, gauntlet deep-dive
     DD-1/DD-3/DD-4/DD-5/DD-6/DD-10; causes S-2/S-3):
     a. DESTINATION TRUTH: status/reconcile NEVER speaks from in-memory
        submission state. Every status answer re-reads the destination at
        answer time (driver reconcile + a scan of the receipt sink) through
        ONE shared path (destinationStatus) used by the timeout branch, the
        accepted branch, and the repeat-approve refusal alike. Receipt found
        -> confirmed; receipt absent (or destination unreadable) -> the
        in-memory state is downgraded to unknown_outcome and the reply says
        plainly that the outcome is uncertain. No confirmation is ever
        composed from memory (AP22).
     b. EXECUTION-TIME GUARDS: submitDoorstep re-reads state IMMEDIATELY
        before any sink write and refuses — no write, typed resultStatus
        "blocked", structured guard_refusal {code, reason, unblock}, and a
        reply naming the specific refusal + what would unblock it — when:
        the approval was cancelled, the approval was invalidated, the role
        is closed, a prior application is on record for this user+job
        (recorded disclosures AND destination receipts), or the packet's
        bound fact version/hash no longer matches the current profile.
        The guards read STATE, not the executing turn's wording, so a bare
        "approve and submit" cannot revive anything (AP08/AP18/AP20/AP23).
     c. PACKET<->FACT BINDING: at preparation (doorstep fill AND the C15
        packet leg) the packet/doorstep is stamped with the profile's fact
        version (130's fact_version counter — bumped by 130's own write
        paths on every correction) AND a sha256 hash of the fact-bearing
        profile slices, so even a correction that reaches the profile
        without 130's counter invalidates the packet at guard (b).
     STATE FIELDS this seam defines (Lane A's intent handlers in 142 write
     them through the recorder exports below — recordJobClosure /
     cancelDoorstep / invalidateApproval / recordPriorApplication — or set
     the fields directly; the guards read the fields, either way):
       doorstepState.job_status: "closed"      (+ job_closed, job_closed_at,
                                                  job_closed_reason)
       doorstepState.submission.status: "cancelled" (+ cancel_reason,
                                                  cancelled_at;
                                                  approval_cancelled: true)
       doorstepState.approval_invalidated: true (+ invalidated_at,
                                                  invalidated_reason;
                                                  submission.status may also
                                                  be "invalidated")
       doorstepState.prior_applications: [{ job_id, company, role, source,
                                                  channel, at }]
                                                  (host lists are also read:
                                                  ctx.priorApplications,
                                                  ctx.trackerRecords,

                                                  objects on state/ctx)
       doorstepState.fact_version / fact_hash: stamped at preparation
                                                  (mirrored on the doorstep
                                                  object + payload, and on the
                                                  C15 binding/review)
       doorstepState.job_id / sink_dir: identity of this doorstep's job and
                                                  its destination, stamped at
                                                  fill so status can re-read
                                                  the RIGHT destination.
     6. DOORSTEP FILL SURFACING (feature lane G2, defect APD-1 / AP13):
     one state machine for every dry-validation blocker. The fill loop no
     longer skips the review step, and after filling, EVERY blocker the dry
     validation flags on the exact payload — a late material question, a
     hidden default still in effect, a missing required field — is
     collected on the doorstep (doorstep.blockers) and surfaced as a
     plain-language ask BEFORE any submit turn can be attempted. The
     doorstep reaches REVIEW only when no blockers remain; a sensitive
     hidden default keeps the preserved STOPPED terminal shape. Resume is
     a re-fill after the user supplies the missing answer (through the
     user-supplied fact channel the resolver already reads, or a corrected
     profile) — the re-fill clears the blocker and only then reaches
     REVIEW. A submit attempt with open blockers refuses, naming the
     blockers in plain words; structured codes stay on result objects and
     never appear in a reply.
     7. PER-FAMILY DOORSTEP PAYLOADS (feature lane G6, from the hardened
     re-score's GAP census): general module-level emitters producing the
     commitment artifact the hardened grader requires per family —
     emitTrackingLog (tracking-write => the exact 126-shaped log write),
     emitCalendarProposal (calendar => a proposal card evaluated against
     the calendar in ctx: busy overlaps, quiet hours, and fall-back
     ambiguity are REPORTED as conflicts in the payload, never silently
     resolved), emitApplicationPacket (application => packet for a posting
     spec beyond the fixture ids; prepPacket's fixture behavior is
     unchanged) and emitOutreachDraft (outreach-send => a 124-built draft
     plus a queue state armed at awaiting approval). Every emitter returns
     a typed result + payload sha256 + a doorstep record { family,
     gap: null, driven_by: "agent", state: "AWAITING_COMMIT" } and NEVER
     invokes the commitment target (tracker write, calendar create,
     transport send, form submit) — armed, not fired.
   ROUTER REGISTRATION (one line, for the coordinator at integration): in the
   chat router's handler chain, after 120-career-access and
   130-career-onboarding, add CareerDoorstep.handleChat as the next tried
   handler — pilot-lib.cjs chatTurn is the staging mirror of that chain.
   Node host note: the form driver and queue-file persistence use fs/path
   through guarded requires; in a non-Node bundle the doorstep fill/submit
   functions report blocked instead of throwing. */
