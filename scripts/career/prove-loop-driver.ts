//   workers/career-cloud/worker.ts cloudEngineRunner) -> the questions it stopped on, asked once (ask-once.ts
//   questionsToStore) and answered from the TEST persona -> prepare again -> the card (supabase/functions/_shared/
//   career_apply_cards.ts cardTurn: "show my applications", then the person's tap on that card) -> the queued payload
//   is the one the card's hash names -> assertApprovedPayload (the cloud worker's own before-effects check) -> a fresh
//   page filled from the approved payload alone (factsFromPayload, as runCloudJob builds it) must give the engine the
//   same approval hash, field by field read back. Then it stops: no --submit is ever passed for a real employer.
// With fixtureSubmit (a local captured form whose own form posts to the local fixture server only), the approved job
// then goes through runCloudJob itself, so the receipt path is proven end to end against the fixture.
