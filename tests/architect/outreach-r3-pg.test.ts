// OUTREACH R3 END TO END (2026-10-31): sampled flows on real Postgres 16 (every migration) through the sending rail's own
// functions, the outreach store over the PostgREST double with the chat's own hand-off (agent-chat handler-career.ts:
// outreachTurn -> onApproved -> queueApprovedOutreach), the worker and the reply check, and a fake Gmail at the HTTP
// boundary. The pure battery is tests/architect/scenarios-outreach-r3.test.ts; this reads the database's rows and what
// "Gmail" received. Nothing leaves the machine; no model is called.
//   A  two approvals of the same address at once (two batches, two chats, two sessions): one email.
//   B  a draft approved, edited, approved again before the worker ran: exactly the new version goes, once.
//   C  an approval the rail refuses for good (opted out with anyone, bounced for anyone, already emailed): the chat says
//      so and the draft says why; nothing goes to them.
//   D  a stop, a bounce, or an answer on a follow-up's sequence recorded after the claim and before the send: never sent;
//      the email ends cancelled with the reason; the rest of the claim goes once each.
//   E  a retried email whose approval passed 7 days: not sent (lapsed, draft lapses) unless the earlier try went (then
//      recorded as sent, once).
//   F  an opt-out after Gmail's snippet, read by the reply check: the address is on the do-not-contact list and another
//      person's email to it is cancelled.
//   G  every final state has a readable reason, and one person's actions never touch another's rows.
