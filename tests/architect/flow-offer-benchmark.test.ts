// FEATURE 12 (DIAGNOSIS 2.13, fix F6): offers and negotiation backed by market numbers, through the REAL handler
// (handleChat) on real Postgres. The pay datasets are the WO-036 test fixtures (tests/fixtures/career-pay, invented rows
// built by the real importers; never DOL or BLS data), set on the offer turn's data source; the posted pay ranges are
// career_postings rows as the ingest writes them (the board's own pay field). Then a person's words: an offer, a second
// offer whose employer filed too few wages for a median (the n < 5 refusal), rate checks with and without enough
// postings, "compare my two offers", "help me negotiate" (the counter on a card citing the benchmark, nothing sent), a
// half-told offer asked once, and a plain "I got an offer!" left to the router.
