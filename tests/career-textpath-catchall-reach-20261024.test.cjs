/* CATCH-ALL REACHABILITY + BARE-REPLY WORDING (coordinator held-out
   rerun at 42621793, 2026-10-24) — fail-first.

   His private fresh set went banner 24/30 -> 17/30 at the
   generalization head, but the catch-all fired ONCE in 30 turns:
   unmatched in-scope asks still exited as the banner. Diagnosis
   (recorded in the lane report): the catch-all's gate required a
   question/request SPEECH ACT and a closed domain word list, so
   career statements, reported speech, fragments and context-only
   follow-ups were declined and exited via the legacy keyword tail
   inside dispatch or as a null the host containment wraps in the
   same banner text. Two wording defects ride along: a closing
   phrase ("never mind") recorded as the last-discussed topic, and
   "Nothing has been discussed yet" after earlier (unserved) turns,
   because the discussion record was serve-gated.

   These families are invented HERE — different topics and shapes
   from file v1's fifteen and from the coordinator's private set:
     - passed over for a promotion (statement)
     - which skill to learn first (question, no career lexicon)
     - a trainee got the role the user wanted (statement)
     - is a masters worth it (question, credential vocabulary)
     - bombed the final round (statement)
     - performance-plan news, then "what do i do first" (context)
     - references, then "can you email them" (context)
     - a bare fragment naming a profession and a city
   Controls pin the other side of the line: trivia, food, a
   pleasantry and a finance ask are NOT claimed by the catch-all.
