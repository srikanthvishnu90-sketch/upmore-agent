// Mass submission at scale (owner, 2026-10-27 19:52 "operate these things at large scale", 19:55 "never set a limit"), on a
// real Postgres 16 with the career schema and the leased, fair claim this lane asks the database lane for
// (tests/flow/host-backoff.sql, the reference SQL of the Request; never applied to a live project):
//   SCALE_PEOPLE people x SCALE_PER items queued (defaults 10,000 x 50 = 500,000; CI-sized by env), plus one heavy person
//   with SCALE_HEAVY items, on SCALE_HOSTS employer hosts, two of which refuse once (a 429 with Retry-After);
//   SCALE_WORKERS worker processes (tests/flow/scale-worker.ts: the real scheduler, mass-run.ts massRun, its journal and the
//   shared host gate), each SCALE_CONCURRENCY engines at once, the engine a stand-in taking ENGINE_MS (the browser and
//   employer pages are measured in mass-submit-pg.test.ts; here the database and the scheduler are).
//   One worker is SIGKILLed mid-run and another started in its place.
// Checked: every item ends in a recorded state, or is a drive the killed worker held (swept unknown, never driven again);
// no engine ever started twice for one item; fairness (in the first claims every person had a first item started before
// anyone had a third); the heavy person never starved others and others never starved them; the refusing hosts were
// held off for every instance (no start on them inside the Retry-After window after their refusal, by any worker); no
// global lock (claims run in parallel: total throughput grows with workers). The measured numbers are printed.
// Run: bash tests/flow/run-real-flow.sh tests/architect/mass-scale-pg.test.ts   (SCALE_* to size it)
