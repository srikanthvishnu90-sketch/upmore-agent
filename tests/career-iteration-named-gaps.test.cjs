/* ITERATION LANE guard (2026-10-17, branch iterate/named-gaps) — the
   depth-integration merge record's named NOT-PERFECT items, replayed
   on the DEPLOYED path (real CareerHost, real chain modules,
   production commit semantics), one section per gap:

   BUG-271 (merge record §6 item 1): a bare eligibility ask was
   answered by the record self-check's non-sequitur ("That is not on
   your record — you have not told me yet") because nothing owned the
   grading question. The journey: grade when a posting is resolvable,
   otherwise name the missing inputs (the posting; the specific fact
   the named requirement turns on, with the record's state for it) —
   never an invented verdict.

   BUG-266 (merge record §5.4/§6 item 2): an internship-headed find
   was served by the generic ranked discovery. The reroute is
   deliberate and the http-host pin moved with it; both directions
   are guarded here (internship-headed -> banded route with the
   summer headline; roles/jobs-headed -> generic, unchanged).

   BUG-272 (v227 live verification residue): restating an
   already-held fact ("I'm based in Denver" with Denver on record)
   wrote nothing — correctly — and then fell to the generic fallback
   because the stated-facts reply only fired on NEW captures. The
   journey: acknowledge the fact as already on record, read back from
   the record, write nothing, claim no fresh capture.
