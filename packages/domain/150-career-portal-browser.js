/* Career portal browser driver — the CA-03 real-board seam behind module
   149's page-adapter ("board") contract (Spec 2 §6).
   What this module IS: a Playwright-class driver (via
   scripts/career/portal-browser-helper.cjs, a dumb DOM executor holding
   one isolated browser context per board) that opens a REAL hosted
   application form, discovers its fields, and lets module 149's pipeline
   fill it from confirmed facts only and stop at the final review screen
   — the doorstep — with the exact would-submit payload snapshot.
   §6.3 rules, enforced here as code, on top of 149's own checks:
     - host allowlist at the driver itself: only the tested ATS families
       (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, SmartRecruiters) plus localhost test
       pages may be opened; aggregators and unknown hosts are refused
       BEFORE any navigation (DRIVER_HOST_REFUSED). The gate holds on
       EVERY hop, not just the initial URL (BUG-060 / lane defect D1 —
       boards redirect Greenhouse -> the employer's own site): the
       helper aborts an off-allowlist main-frame navigation before any
       network traffic, and this driver re-checks the final URL after
       open and after the review step; an off-list landing is a typed
       HOST_REDIRECT_REFUSED stop with zero further actions;
     - a visible captcha / human-verification challenge at open or at the
       review step surfaces as { captcha: "challenge" } so 149 stops with
       CAPTCHA_HANDOFF. At that stop the driver captures a screenshot of
       the stopped page and returns it as `screenshotRef`; 149 surfaces it
       on the result as `screenshot_ref` (captcha-pack M4 — the handoff
       ticket in module 120 cannot mint without one). This module contains
       no solver and no disguise technique, ever — background captcha
       scripts are reported as captchaTech evidence, never interacted with;
     - the resume file is uploaded only after its bytes hash to the exact
       sha256 the profile carries (RESUME_SHA_MISMATCH otherwise);
     - every fill is VERIFIED (BUG-207 / D11): the helper reads each
       field back after the board settles and re-fills a fresh node when
       a remount cycle dropped the value; a fill the board will not hold
       is a recorded fill failure, never a silent success;
     - a confirmation is read ONLY from a labeled confirmation context
       (BUG-208 / D12), and never from a page where the application form
       itself is still open — posting prose cannot mint a SUBMITTED;
     - the submit leg is ARMED-ONLY: board.submit() throws
       REAL_SUBMIT_DISABLED unless the board is armed. Arming happens
       exactly two ways (BUG-063 / lane defect D3): (a) the board was
       created with submitArmed: true — the test lane's explicit switch;
       or (b) module 149's approval gate calls board.armForSubmit()
       with approvedByUser AND an approvalRef naming the owner's batch
       approval — approval without the ref arms nothing, and the
       default path stays the refusal. An armed submit clicks
       exactly once and then CAPTURES the employer's confirmation
       (landing-page text, any confirmation/application ID, screenshot);
       the outcome is "accepted" only when that capture carries an ID or
       unambiguous success text — anything else is "unknown", which 149
       records as unknown_outcome, never as sent. submissionState()
       reports from the same capture: confirmed → submitted; ambiguous →
       unverifiable (reconcile must not clear it for a retry).
   Session isolation (§6.3): every board owns a fresh browser context —
   no cookies, storage, or values are shared between boards or users.
   Account model: boards that need no account (Greenhouse / Lever /
   Ashby public forms) run anonymously. Account-walled families
   (Workday, iCIMS, Taleo) are mapped in docs/career/board-automation-map.md
   with the least-user design (per-employer account, user-owned details,
   vaulted credential, one-time approval, Gmail verification retrieval);
   this driver does not create accounts and refuses nothing about them —
   classifyTarget in 149 still gates which hosts may be driven at all.
   Playwright is a lazy, guarded require: the module loads anywhere, and
   only board.open() needs the browser helper. Not part of the edge
   router bundle (it is Node-side tooling, like ci-browse). UMD-ish. */
