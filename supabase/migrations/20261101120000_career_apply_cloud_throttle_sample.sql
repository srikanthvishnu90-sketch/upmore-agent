-- MASS APPLY (2026-11-01): the cloud throttle's failure-rate rule waits for a real sample. As written (20261021080000) a
-- portal's window starts empty after each pause, so ONE error in its first few attempts was "2% of the window" and paused
-- that ATS (Greenhouse, Lever or Ashby) for 6 hours for every person: one batch's single failure stopped everyone's
-- batches. Now the failure-rate rule needs at least 20 attempts in the window (2% of 50 still pauses, as before); the
-- bot-check rule (2 verification checks in the last 20 attempts) and the person's own pause (2 checks in a day) are
-- unchanged, and a posting closed after the approval is recorded not_sent (workers/career-cloud/worker.ts POSTING_CLOSED),
-- never an error. Every other line is 20261021080000's. Idempotent; not applied to any database by this change.
