// Backend gap map G4 (D-011): an application is prepared before the person asks. The server's caller of the queue
// path's preparation: for each posting the person's job alerts already sent them (career_apply_prepare_candidates), the
// engine's dry run (scripts/apply.ts, which plans the form with career_apply.ts planBatch) on the employer's page, with
// the person's own confirmed answers and the resume tailored to this posting, stored as the prepared application their
// card reads (career_apply_prepare_for). A posting that asks what no confirmed fact answers is asked of them once
// (career_apply_prepare_ask_for). Nothing is approved, queued or sent here: the card, and the person's one text, decide.
//
// The facts: only what the trust contract keeps (extension/src/apply_core.ts trustedManifest, WO-102). Here that is the
// person's own answers to questions they were asked (career_apply_answers_for) and, when a profile reader is given, the
// facts of their stored profile that carry the owner's confirmation event (trustedProfile, the allowlist every other
// submission path applies). Nothing else is a fact: not one the router confirmed without an event, not a draft, not a
// fact with no confirmation at all. The one filtered profile is what the facts file, the resume and the drafter see.
// The resume: the one tailored to this posting from their confirmed facts (career_tailor.ts tailorForPosting: truth
// audit, render, ATS parse), stored privately at career-resumes/<user_id>/<sha256>.pdf and bound into the payload by its
// hash, with resume_tailored (career_apply_resume_tag marks the queued job tailored only when that exact file is stored).
// A posting it cannot tailor for is not prepared (no_resume): nothing goes out with a resume the person did not get.
// Every try is recorded (career_apply_prepare_attempt_for), so a posting is retried once a week at most, or as soon as
// the questions it stopped on are answered.
// The cover letter: when a posting asks for one typed into a text box, it is drafted from the person's confirmed facts by
// the chat's own drafter (essay_draft.ts draftEssay: the employer's AI policy first, every name and number traced to a
// confirmed fact) and kept beside the question (career_apply_question_draft_put_for). It is never their answer: the chat
// shows it whole when they ask, only their "use N" saves it, and the posting is then prepared again with it.
//
// Usage (the worker host, the service role; never on a schedule from here; docs/launch/CLOUD-RUNNER.md "Preparation host"):
//   SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... deno run -A workers/career-browser/prepare-ahead.ts once [--limit N] [--draft-cover-letters]
// Mass submission (owner, 2026-10-27: no product number, "never set a limit", "operate at large scale"): every posting
// the database offers is prepared, as many at once as this machine has browsers for, every employer site at full
// parallelism unless it refuses (then held off for every host, through the database). Many hosts run at once:
// PREPARE_AHEAD_SHARD="i/n" gives each its share of the people. --limit N (the owner's) reads one page of N.
// --draft-cover-letters calls the model (the gateway's provider, paid) once or twice for each cover letter drafted; without
// it none is drafted ahead, and the person can still say "draft N" in the chat.
