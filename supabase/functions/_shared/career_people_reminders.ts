// Introduction reminders, pushed (D-033 as amended 2026-10-27, #217 follow-up): a reminder the person asked for
// ("remind me in 5 days") used to exist only as a line shown at their next message — nothing ever reached them if
// they stayed silent. This is the scheduled half, and it follows the same shape as every other rail: the
// career-proactive run plans AT the due time from the record as it then stands (PeopleStore.dueIntros mirrors the
// in-chat filter: armed, unreminded, still approved or sent — a reply recorded before the date clears the ask and
// nothing is queued), queues ONE text per reminder to career_outbox (kind "followup", once per key, ever), and
// marks the intro reminded so the in-chat line never repeats a pushed reminder. The run is wired only with
// CAREER_INTRO_REMINDERS=on (career-proactive/index.ts); with it off, reminders behave exactly as before (in-chat
// only, and the remind reply says so, read off the same flag).
//
// What is queued is the reminder (introReminderText: "Reminder you asked for: intro N … has no reply on record"),
// never the introduction itself: Trainee never sends an introduction (D-033) — the note is the person's to send,
// by mailto link or copied text, after hash-bound approval. Delivery from the outbox is the texting channel's job,
// as with alerts and receipts; this module proves the queueing, not the delivery.
