// anything older, and is answered by code from what the database says, in one line:
//   - still waiting to go (an application queued and not yet claimed by a worker; an approved email the send rail has not
//     claimed): it is cancelled, and the line says so;
//   - being sent right now: said plainly, nothing claimed;
//   - already out: said plainly, with what can still be done (withdraw with the employer; a follow-up email);
//   - already cancelled, or never sent: said so; nothing older is touched by a second "undo".
// The cancels are the existing, race-safe ones: career_apply_cancel_for (queued, attempts 0, under the person's lock; the
// claims take only 'queued') and the outreach draft's approved -> skipped compare-and-set, which the send rail's claim
// reads under FOR UPDATE and turns into a cancelled queue row ("approval withdrawn"). A store that cannot be read says so;
// nothing is guessed.
