# A throwaway Postgres 16 with the career schema in the same order CI's tests/db/run.sh builds it: the migrations
# run.sh names before its production-ledger step, in that order; then every other migration in filename order (what the
# ledger step applies, after its baseline); never the draft card-cloud bridge (DRAFT / NOT APPLIED, not in production),
# unless INCLUDE_BRIDGE=1: then the bridge too, at its filename position, outside a transaction (it owns BEGIN/COMMIT), as
# apply-rails-and-seed.sh applies it. Prints the socket directory and port as `PGHOST=... PGPORT=...` on the last line.
# Nothing here touches the live project.
# Usage: [INCLUDE_BRIDGE=1] bash tests/flow/provision-pg.sh <work-dir> <port>     (stop: pg_ctl -D <work-dir>/data -m immediate stop)
